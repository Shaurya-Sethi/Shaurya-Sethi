# Hi, I'm Shaurya 👋

I'm a final year Electrical Engineering student at VIT (graduating 2026), currently interning as an ML Engineer at Havells.  
I’m passionate about building practical AI and deep learning solutions that bridge the gap between code and the real world.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: PCB Design Assistant using LLMs, NL2SQL transformers, and more.
- 🌱 I’m exploring: ML on the cloud (specifically GCP), Rust, and low-level ML in high-performance languages like C.
- 💡 Favorite tech: Python, PyTorch, R, Transformers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy building things from scratch—whether it’s neural networks, DIY electronics, or the perfect cup of coffee.
